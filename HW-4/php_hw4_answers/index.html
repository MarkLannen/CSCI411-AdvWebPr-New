    <h1>Answers for Homework 4</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Q: What are the different methods of concatenation and to what data types (and literals) do they
            apply?</p>
            <p>A: There are 2 concatenation methods for strings.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The "." operator concatenates two strings together. Returns concatenation of right and left argument.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ".=" appends the argument on the right to the argument on the left.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Q: Describe at least three different ways to declare and initialize an array</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Array function: $fruit = array('apples', 'oranges', 'bananas');</li>
                <li>Arrays that are automatically indexed: $fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas];</li>
                <li>Associative arrays: $fruit = array("1"=>"apple", "2"=>"oranges", "3"=>"bananas");</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: How do you store the results of print_r() to a variable?</p>
            <p>A: Call the built-in function 'print_r and pass in a variable as an argument.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    $fruit = 'apple';</br>
                    print_r($fruit);
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is the var_dump function? How is it different than print_r?</p>
            <p>A: var_dump is a built in function that prints an argument passed to it, along with the
                arguments type and value.</br> print_r just displays the content of the argument, i.e., string, array etc. and does not
                include type or value information.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is dynamic typing? Describe some advantages and disadvantages</p>
            <p>A: If a programming language is dynamically typed, it means that a variables data type is checked during
                run-time as opposed to when being compiled. An advantage is that the programming process can be sped up
                somewhat as the programmer does not have to manually declare data types for all variables.
                A disadvantage is that if there is a type-error, it won't be caught until the program is trying to run, rather
                than when it is being compiled.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is the output of the following programs?</p>
            <p>A:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        int(1) string(7) "just no" int(2) int(2)</br>
                        First x is declared as 1, then printed with var_dump. Then y and z are assigned to the value of x + x.
                        Then x is reassigned to the string "just no." Then all 3 are printed out using var_dump.
                        I didn't understand how y and z were being assigned until I printed the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Array ( [2] => 0 [Melissa] => 1 [0] => 2 ) array(3) { [2]=> int(0) ["Melissa"]=> int(1) [0]=> int(2) } string(55) "Array ( [2] => 0 [Melissa] => 1 [0] => 2 ) " </br>
                        First even_numbers is assigned to an empty array. Then an associative array is created using keys and values.
                        The array is then printed and then var_dumped. Finally var_dump is called on print_r of the array.</br>
                        I anticipated most of what was going to happen, but found it difficult to anticipate what calling var_dump on print_r would do.

                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
